> **${var}** — Focus area or theme override. If empty, covers everything shipped this week.

Read memory/MEMORY.md and the last 7 days of memory/logs/ for context.
Read memory/watched-repos.md for repos to cover.

## Steps

1. **Gather the full week of activity** for each watched repo (read repo list from `memory/watched-repos.md`):
   ```bash
   # For each REPO in watched-repos.md:

   # Commits from the last 7 days
   gh api repos/${REPO}/commits -X GET -f since="$(date -u -d '7 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ 2>/dev/null || date -u -v-7d +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --jq '.[] | {sha: .sha[0:7], full_sha: .sha, message: .commit.message | split("\n")[0], author: .commit.author.name, date: .commit.author.date}' --paginate

   # PRs merged this week
   gh api repos/${REPO}/pulls -X GET -f state=closed -f sort=updated -f direction=desc --jq '[.[] | select(.merged_at != null) | select(.merged_at > (now - 604800 | strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"))) | {number, title, user: .user.login, merged_at, labels: [.labels[].name]}]'

   # Releases this week
   gh api repos/${REPO}/releases --jq '[.[] | select(.published_at > (now - 604800 | strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"))) | {tag_name, name, published_at, body}]'
   ```

2. **Read this week's push-recap articles** from `articles/push-recap-*.md` (last 7 days) to get detailed diff context without re-fetching everything.

3. **Read diffs for the most significant commits** (top 10 by lines changed) to understand substance:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/${REPO}/commits/FULL_SHA --jq '{files: [.files[] | {filename, status, additions, deletions}], stats: .stats}'
   ```

4. **Synthesize into a narrative shiplog.** This is NOT a changelog or diff dump. Write it as a story of the week:
   - What was the main thrust? What moved the project forward?
   - What new capabilities exist now that didn't a week ago?
   - What problems got solved?
   - What's the pace/momentum like compared to recent weeks?

5. **Search the web** briefly for any external mentions, reactions, or related ecosystem developments that give context to the shipping.

6. **Write a 800-1200 word article** to `articles/weekly-shiplog-${today}.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Week in Review: [Compelling title capturing the week's theme]

   *${today} — Weekly shipping update*

   ### [Feature/Theme 3 if applicable]
   [Same treatment]

   ## Fixes & Improvements
